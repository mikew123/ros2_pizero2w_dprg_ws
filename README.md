# DPRG ROS demo project for the club
This project is to make an in-expensive wheeled robot with sensors using ROS2 to demonstrate a simple ROS2 hardware robot.</br>
Initially the robot will be driven manually using a joystick or the keyboard and the sensor will cause an LED to flash faster when an object is closer.</br>
